Project Overview
The Med On Call system is built to ensure the safety of individuals, particularly the elderly or those with mobility issues. The project consists of an Arduino system integrated with a watch-like device that detects sudden falls. Upon detecting a fall, the system triggers an alert and sends the data to the connected web interface, where it can be accessed by caregivers or medical professionals.

Technologies Used
This project is a combination of software and hardware components. The main technologies used are:

Arduino: Microcontroller used to detect falls through sensors.
Java: Backend logic for processing fall data and managing alerts.
HTML/CSS: Frontend interface for the web-based dashboard, where users can monitor fall detection events.
JavaScript: Handles real-time updates on the dashboard.
MySQL: Database for storing fall events and user data.
Features
Fall Detection: Detects falls in real-time using sensors connected to the Arduino device.
Alert System: Sends alerts to family members or medical personnel when a fall is detected.
Web Dashboard: Provides a user-friendly interface to view real-time fall detection events and system status.
User Management: Allows caregivers to manage user profiles and monitor their activity.
Mobile Responsive: The web interface is mobile-friendly, ensuring that alerts can be monitored on the go.
